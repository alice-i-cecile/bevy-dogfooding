# Match Three Engine Builder

## Pitch

Create your own synergistic engine, powered by simple and satisfying gameplay of match three games.

Puzzle Quest had a ton of interesting ideas and great juice, but the interactive elements kind of fell flat.
We can steal the progression from tabletop engine builder games to create a fascinating long-lived experience.

## Gameplay

Match 3!

Gather resources by matching three or more elements in a line.

Spend resources to use abilities, changing the board in powerful and interesting ways.
Gain more abilities over the course of each run.

Clear levels by matching enough elements, and make sure your engine is functioning smoothly enough to overcome obstacles.

### Open questions

- What challenges can we present to players?
- Do we want something like different base classes?

## Setting

High magic steampunk fantasy with an alchemical flavor.
Lean on vibes from Opus Magnum, and focus on a research-based vibe rather than combat.

## Art Direction

Polished illustrations.
Lots of particles, shake and satisfying animations.

## Business Model

- Cheap premium game: $10-20 on Steam
- PC-first
  - Steam Deck support for touch-based swiping and abilities
  - probably a mobile port eventually?
- Easily extended with more challenges and abilities

## Goal evaluation

Good:

- really simple core gameplay loop
  - should be easy to get to the crunchy design and polish problems
- success relies heavily on polish and juice
- game design heavy: mechanics, balance and systems
- very low asset requirements
- easily ported to web, mobile, console as desired

Bad:

- very procedural
  - no editor needed!
- not a particularly impressive showcase of Bevy
  - mostly shows off design skills!
- virality is so-so: hard to sell audiences on clips of match three gameplay
