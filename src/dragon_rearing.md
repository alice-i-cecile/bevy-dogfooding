# Dragon Rearing

## Pitch

Raise a tiny dragon from egg to flying, fire-breathing adult before setting it free.

Definitely a mobile game, but wholesome, non-predatory and high quality. Neopets for the modern age.

## Gameplay

Feed, play with, train and teach your dragon.
Check in on it regularly to make sure it's happy.

Dragon makes requests and sets small goals for you.
Can always play more, but infrequent play gets bonuses (following the rested experience model of WoW).

Focus on compelling, interesting minigames and fun interactions.

Develop traits (personality and physical) based on training and items.

When the dragon is grown up, prestige and restart the cycle with some durable boosts.
Experiment with different types of dragons each restart.

### Open questions

- What's the exact gameplay loop and progression?
- What minigame mechanics are we using to sell each activity?

## Setting

A wholesome fantasy setting.
The player is trying to re-establish wild populations of dragons after they were nearly driven extinct,
and relies on donations to make ends meet.

## Art Direction

Charming pixel art with bright colors and fantasy vibes.

Illustrated look is cheap, but is a red flag for quality and predatory monetization.

Pixel-based skeumorphic clones of Tamagotchi are too limiting, and rely entirely on vibes.

## Business Model

Freemium with microtransactions:

- generous free premium currency
- cheat to buy progress
- skins with gameplay bonuses for owning
- utility items
  - freeze dragon in time to prevent going hungry while you're away
  - guaranteed dragon types

## Goal evaluation

Good:

- explores mobile game support
- pixel art is an important niche that relies on high engine polish
- charming with a clear concept
- really heavy on systems design and compelling gameplay
  - balancing wholesome vs monetizable
  - balancing compelling gameplay vs approachable

Bad:

- relies heavily on art execution
- mobile games are such a hard market and consumer skepticism is high
