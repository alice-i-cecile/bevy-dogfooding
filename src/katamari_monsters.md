# Katamari Monsters

## Pitch

Tiny terrors wreak charming chaos.

Let's blend the delight of Katamari Damacy with the playful horror of Furbies.

## Gameplay

Destroy as much of the home as possible before you're caught.

The player's focus is on weird, interesting movement, bonking into objects and planning an efficient path through the level.

Pick a monster and a level and compete for high scores, gradually unlocking new experiences.

### Open questions

- Katamari relies on the size increase mechanic to control / gate paths through the level and provide progression. How can we acheieve something similar?

## Setting

In homes across the world, a popular line of toys has suddenly come to life, wreaking domestic havoc.

If Kaiju are all about embodying societal problems as terrifying monsters, our little creatures try to capture a much more personal set of fears.

Very light narration / plot: just mock news reports.

## Art Direction

Playful, bright, ultra low polygon. No physics colliders here baby!

Levels are normal, wholesome household environments.
They have a bit of a diorama feel to them, and tell some simple but charming stories via environmental storytelling.

## Business Model

- pretty standard $10-20 Steam game
  - maybe add cheap DLC or free patches with new levels / characters
- ship a demo
- encourage use of controllers
  - great on Steam Deck!
  - would be a strong candidate for consoles if that ever happens
- market via strong social media clips.

## Goal evaluation

Good:

- lets me explore character controllers, physics and level design in Bevy
- doesn't have the art budget or technical requirements of a classic humanoid action-adventure game
- vertical slice is nice and small: this would be sane as a jam game
- familiar but fresh, action-heavy concept should do well on social media
  - very memeable!

Bad:

- pretty light on crunchy systems that I tend to really enjoy / do well with
- oh my god there's going to be so much 3D modelling and level design
