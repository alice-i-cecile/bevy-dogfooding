### About this Game

"What if my toys came to life?" Live out your childhood dream (or nightmare) in this charming, quirky action game.
Inspired by the beloved cult classic *Katamari Damacy*, your goal is to cause as much chaos as possible in each home before the residents wake up and catch you.

Each toy has a unique set of actions, flying, hopping, grappling or driving through a small-scale world.
Take advantage of the physics-based environmental interaction to master each level, competing for a high score as you discover and complete bonus objectives for each level.

Watch out though: causing too much noise will wake the residents, and they'll soon come chasing after you with nets, brooms and more to put an end to your spree.

Wreaking havoc has never been this delightful.
