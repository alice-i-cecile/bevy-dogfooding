# Project Goals

Why am I making this project? Well:

- showcase what can be done with Bevy
- teach people how to use Bevy
- find (and then fix) problems with Bevy
- develop my skills as a game dev
- enjoy the development process

## Resources

What do we have to work with?

- Alice's time, one day a week
  - strong programmer
  - solid game design
  - great at writing
  - no audio experience
  - basic 3D modelling
  - decent vector art
  - absolutely terrible raster art
- random contributions
  - probably mostly programming
  - focused on fun and interesting tasks
  - any art style will be inconsistent
- maybe a small art budget
  - will go towards creating Creative Commons assets
- zero marketing budget
  - any money we put into this is way better spent on art!
  - open source + personal social media draw might help?

If this really catches fire, we could sell it, and put the money earned into upgrading assets.

## Implied constraints

Taking a look at the goals and resources available, what constraints are bounding our design?

### Must have

- very small
  - we really don't have a lot of time or money to make something with!
  - we need to get to a vertical slice quickly to start polishing
  - bigger / more interesting than a jam but looking at a $10 price point on Steam
- high on polish
  - critical for showcasing Bevy and catching issues
- low on art assets
  - classic programmer shit frankly
  - I'm surprisingly okay at art as long as there's no fine motor skills involved though
- cannot ship to modern conosles
  - no Bevy support yet!
- something I love and am excited about
  - the best concept on paper doesn't matter: I need to be motivated to actually do the work
  - understanding / appreciating the genre also helps a lot

## Nice to have

- simple, consistent and charming art direction
  - by far the best way to stretch a limited art budget
- a strong, focused concept
  - marketing is entirely organic: should be memorable but clear
- tests useful areas of Bevy
  - that means both "almost ready" and "relevant to normal game devs"
  - weird art games and proc-gen heavy stuff are already proven
  - mobile games? web? 3D? level creation? physics? character controllers? dialog?
